This website is the final project in CS 462, Intro to Web Development. The purpose of this website is to be a professional website that highlights me and my professional experience. It features an about me page, a previous work page, a page containing a list of projects, and a page that allows the user to contact me. 

The about section contains the navbar, a picture of me, and a brief introduction that highlights my professional experience.

The previous work sections also contains the navbar as well as all previous positions that I have worked in. Each position describes how long I worked there, my title, the company's name, and a brief description of what I did.

The projects section contains three projects that I have previously worked on. Each project section contains its name, a short description of the project, and a link to its github repository.

Finally the contact section contains a form that allows you to enter your name, email, and what you want to ask me. This section does not currently support submission to a server.

The launched website can be found at the following link:
